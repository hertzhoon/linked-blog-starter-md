I will probably tell him to buy a new computer from gigacomputer.
		Win11
			8GB RAM
			an SSD maybe, maybe not neccesssary, depends on if the HDD is shite
			that's all folks


We have agreed that I will build him a new PC.
He wants something future proof, so it can at least live for like 10 years.
Max budget is like 25k crowns.
Need to make sure of compatibility between the items and stuff. 

He gave me a frozen cake and said, that for now his old pc will suffice. In the future we might talk again tho.

Need to put some draft together, so I'm ready when he asks.
